    """
    Run an automated separation of a single tree point cloud.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array
        Three-dimensional point cloud of a single tree to perform the
        wood-leaf separation. This should be a n-dimensional array (m x n)
        containing a set of coordinates (n) over a set of points (m).
    class_file : str
        Path to classes reference values file. This file will be loaded and
        its reference values are used to select wood and leaf classes.
    knn_lst: list
        Set of knn values to use in the neighborhood search in classification
        steps. This variable will be directly used in a step containing
        the function wlseparate_ref_voting  and its minimum value will be used
        in another step containing wlseparate_abs (both from
        classification.wlseparate). These values are directly dependent of
        point density and were defined based on a medium point density
        scenario (mean distance between points aroun 0.05m). Therefore, for
        higher density point clouds it's recommended the use of larger knn
        values for optimal results.
    gmm_nclasses: int
        Number of classes to use in Gaussian Mixture Classification. Default
        is 4.
    cont_filt : boolean
        Option to select if continuity_filter should be applied to wood and
        leaf point clouds. Default is True.
    class_prob_threshold : float
        Classification probability threshold to filter classes. This aims to
        avoid selecting points that are not confidently enough assigned to
        any given class. Default is 0.95.
    cf_rad : float
        Continuity filter search radius.
    verbose : bool
        Option to set (or not) verbose output.

    Returns
    -------
    wood_final : array
        Wood point cloud.
    leaf_final : array
        Leaf point cloud.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array
        Three-dimensional point cloud of a single tree to perform the
        wood-leaf separation. This should be a n-dimensional array (m x n)
        containing a set of coordinates (n) over a set of points (m).
    knn_lst: list
        Set of knn values to use in the neighborhood search in classification
        steps. This variable will be directly used in a step containing
        the function reference_classification  and its minimum and maximum
        values will be used in a different step with threshold_classification
        (both from classification.classify_wood). These values are directl
        dependent of point density and were defined based on a medium point
        density scenario (mean distance between points aroun 0.05m).
        Therefore, for higher density point clouds it's recommended the use of
        larger knn values for optimal results.
    verbose : bool
        Option to set (or not) verbose output.

        Wood point cloud.
    leaf_final : array
        Leaf point cloud.
