def wlseparate_ref_voting(arr, knn_lst, class_file, n_classes=3):

    """
    Classifies a point cloud (arr) into two main classes, wood and leaf.
    Altough this function does not output a noclass category, it still
    filters out results based on classification confidence interval in the
    voting process (if lower than prob_threshold, then voting is not used
    for current point and knn value).

    The final class selection is based a voting scheme applied to a similar
    approach of wlseparate_ref. In this case, the function iterates over a
    series of knn values and apply the reference distance criteria to select
    wood and leaf classes.

    Each knn class result is accumulated in a list and in the end a voting
    is applied. For each point, if the number of times it was classified as
    wood is larger than threhsold, the final class is set to wood. Otherwise
    it is set as leaf.

    Class selection will mask points according to their class mean distance
    to reference classes. The closes reference class gets assignes to each
    intermediate class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array
        Three-dimensional point cloud of a single tree to perform the
        wood-leaf separation. This should be a n-dimensional array (m x n)

    knn_lst : list
        List of knn values to use in the search to constitue local subsets of
        points around each point in 'arr'. It can be a single knn value, as
        long as it has list data type.
    class_file : pandas dataframe or str
        Dataframe or path to reference classes file.
    n_classes : int
        Number of classes to use in the Gaussian Mixture Classification.

    Classifies a point cloud (arr) into three main classes, wood, leaf and

    The final class selection is based on the absolute value of the last

    Points will be only classified as wood or leaf if their classification
    probability is higher than prob_threshold. Otherwise, points are
