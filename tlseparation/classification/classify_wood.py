    """
    Classifies wood material points from a point cloud. This function
    uses *wlseparate_ref_voting* to perform the basic classification and then
    apply *class_filter* to filter out potentially misclassified wood points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point_cloud: numpy.ndarray
        2D (n x 3) array containing n points in 3D space (x, y, z).
    knn_list: list
        List of knn values to be used iteratively in the voting separation.
    n_classes: int
        Number of intermediate classes. Minimum classes should be 3, but
        default value is set to 4 in order to accommodate for noise/outliers
        classes.
    prob_threshold: float
        Classification probability threshold to filter classes. This aims to
        avoid selecting points that are not confidently enough assigned to
        any given class. Default is 0.95.

    Returns
    -------
    wood_points: numpy.ndarray
        2D (nw x 3) array containing n wood points in 3D space (x, y, z).
