    Generates a dictionary of voxels containing their central coordinates

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: array
        Array of points/entries to voxelize.
    voxel_size: float
        Length of all voxels sides/edges.

    Returns
    -------
    vox: defaultdict
        Dictionary containing voxels. Keys are voxels' central coordinates and
        values are indices of points in arr inside each voxel.
