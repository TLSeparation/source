    """
    Downsamples a point cloud by voxelizing it and selecting points closest
    to the median coordinate of all points inside each voxel. The remaining
    points can be stored and returned as a dictrionary for later
    use in upsampling back to original input data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point_cloud : numpy.ndarray
        Three-dimensional (m x n) array of a point cloud, where the
        coordinates are represented in the columns (n) and the points are
        represented in the rows (m).
    downsample_size : float
        Size of the voxels used to sample points into groups and select the
        most central point from. Note that this will not be the final points
        distance from each other, but an approximation.
    return_indices : bool
        Option to return results as downsampled array (False) or the
        indices of downsampled points from original point cloud (True).
    return_neighbors : bool
        Option to return original neighbors of downsampled points (True) or
        not (False). This information can be used to upsample back the
        downsampled indices.
