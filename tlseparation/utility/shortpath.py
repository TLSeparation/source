    """
    Converts a numpy.array of points coordinates into a Weighted BiDirectional
    NetworkX Graph.
    This funcions uses a NearestNeighbor search to determine points adajency.
    The NNsearch results are used to select pairs of points (or nodes) that
    have a common edge.


    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array
        n-dimensional array of points.
    base_id : int
        Index of base id (root) in the graph.
    kpairs : int
        Number of points around each point in arr to select in order to
        build edges.
    knn : int
        Number of neighbors to search around each point in the neighborhood
        phase. The higher the better (careful, it's  memory intensive).
    nbrs_threshold : float
        Maximum valid distance between neighbors points.
    nbrs_threshold_step : float
        Distance increment used in the final phase of edges generation. It's
        used to make sure that in the end, every point in arr will be
        translated to nodes in the graph.
    graph_threshold : float
        Maximum distance between pairs of nodes (edge distance) accepted in
        the graph generation.

    Returns

        Graph containing all points in 'arr' as nodes.
